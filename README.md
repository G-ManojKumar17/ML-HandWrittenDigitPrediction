## **Handwritten Digit Prediction | Machine Learning**  
### **Handwritten Digit Prediction**  

In this project, we developed a **Machine Learning model** to predict handwritten digits based on image data.  

We used the **scikit-learn (sklearn)** library to load the **Digits dataset** using the `load_digits` function. For modeling, we applied the **Random Forest Classifier**, an ensemble learning method that builds multiple decision trees and uses **majority voting** for classification.

### **Key Features:**  
✅ **Supervised Learning Approach** – Trained on labeled data for digit prediction.  
✅ **Random Forest Classifier** – An ensemble method that improves prediction accuracy by combining multiple decision trees.  
✅ **Data Preprocessing** – Image data was preprocessed to ensure optimal input for the model.  
✅ **Train-Test Split** – Data was split into training and testing sets for evaluation.  
✅ **Python & Scikit-learn Implementation** – Utilized popular libraries for machine learning tasks.  

This project demonstrates how machine learning can be applied to recognize and predict handwritten digits.
